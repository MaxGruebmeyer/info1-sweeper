Short summary: Lorem ispum dolor sed...

## Architecture choices
Describe some choices you made along the way here

## Dependencies
Deps needed for building, testing and running go here!

## TODO
- Add build (make? ninja? cmake? taskfile? custom?)
- Add GitHub build pipeline for branches (pull requests, master pushes) incl. Discord Hook for notifications
- Add unit tests with gtest (googletest) - Needs C++ Compiler? If so -> Dependencies

### Features
- First field clicked should never return an explosive(?)
- Additional features as specified in the exercise

### Optional features for later
- Give the user an additional life, if he solves a floating point number conversion -> Needs floating point conversion tool!
- Make a web interface without any additional libraries via the unistd socket api and text templating into an html document
- Host said web interface on AWS incl. automatic deployment on successful CI with terraform IaC
